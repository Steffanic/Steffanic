I'm focusing on finishing my PhD and getting as much experience with Machine Learning Research, and especially Reinforcement Learning, as I possibly can in the meantime. Check out my project repositories, here are a couple that I would like to highlight:

 - [Generative Color Swatch Transformer](https://github.com/Steffanic/SwatchTransformer) Using the transformer architecture to model color palettes trained on palettes from the excellent [palettable](https://github.com/jiffyclub/palettable) package. I've included a sample gif below, and you can try it out at [steffanic.github.io/SwatchTransformer/](https://steffanic.github.io/SwatchTransformer/), too!
 - [MCTS](https://github.com/Steffanic/MCTS) Monte Carlo Tree Search implemented in Python along with a couple of environments that I used to test it out.
 - [Vertical Drying](https://github.com/Steffanic/VerticalDrying) Physics simulation written in C++ with OpenMPI. Crystal formation via evaporating a suspension of rod-like molecules at various rates.
