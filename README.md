I'm focusing on finishing my PhD and getting as much experience with Machine Learning Research and good software engineering practices as I possibly can in the meantime. Check out my project repositories, here are a couple that I would like to highlight:

 - [Streamlit Geolocation Button](https://github.com/Steffanic/streamlit-geolocation) A streamlit component for requesting GPS location from a user.

 - [Generative Color Swatch Transformer](https://github.com/Steffanic/SwatchTransformer) Using the transformer architecture to model color palettes trained on palettes from the excellent [palettable](https://github.com/jiffyclub/palettable) package. I've included a sample gif below, and you can try it out at [steffanic.github.io/SwatchTransformer/](https://steffanic.github.io/SwatchTransformer/), too!
 
 - [MCTS](https://github.com/Steffanic/MCTS) Monte Carlo Tree Search implemented in Python along with 9x9 TicTacToe and CartPole. TicTacToe was solved easily, but CartPole is intractable(as expected) even with a discretized observation space. 
 
 - [Vertical Drying](https://github.com/Steffanic/VerticalDrying) Physics simulation written in C++ with OpenMPI. Crystal formation via evaporating a suspension of rod-like molecules at various rates.
