I'm focusing on finishing my PhD and getting as much experience with Machine Learning Research, and especially Reinforcement Learning, as I possibly can in the meantime. Check out my project repositories, here are a couple that I would like to highlight:

 - [MCTS](https://github.com/Steffanic/MCTS) Monte Carlo Tree Search implemented in Python along with a couple of environments that I used to test it out.
 - [Vertical Drying](https://github.com/Steffanic/VerticalDrying) Physics simulation written in C++ with OpenMPI. Crystal formation via evaporating a suspension of rod-like molecules at various rates.
