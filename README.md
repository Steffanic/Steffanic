I'm focusing my personal efforts on FriendSync, my social gathering app! I think that it can help ease the post-pandemic pains of getting back together and out of the house.
I'm looking for folks to help me take FriendSync to the world! 

In the next 5 years I plan to graduate with my PhD in Physics and establish myself in the space of Machine Learning. I am interested in working on the cutting edge with really smart people!

If my profile caught your eye, drop me a twitter DM! I'd love to chat and get to know other developers!
